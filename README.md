# Bibi
Bomberman game in c with SDL, readapted for the FunKey S. 

The game is very basic and not pretending to break any record, it is however charged with history: this was the very first game developped by one of the FunKey S founder (Vincent Buso). The code is simply readapted for the FunKey S, not cleaned, refactored or anything. This bodes well for an easter egg, watch out.
